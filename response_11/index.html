        <h3>Questions/Topics</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tim Berners Lee said, &ldquo;I want the web to reflect our hopes and fulfill our dreams, rather than magnify our fears and deepen our divisions.&rdquo; How can the web be moderated without stifling free expression? Should the web be regulated at all? Would the author’s idea about individuals creating websites and getting away from social media solve the issue of deepening divides throughout the world?</li>
            <br>
            <li>I agree with the author’s students’ experience about the transition from learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to actually feeling like you’ve built a modern website. When does an amateur developer's skills become professional-grade?</li>
