        <h3>Questions/Topics</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>What groups are truly neutral in advocating for or against “network neutrality”? Between the very large tech companies and federal government, secret courts, and complex terms of service, who advocates for users and their data in the best way to move forward to balance customers’ personal data security and “national safety interests”?</li>
            <br>
            <li>Does the global nature of data and the cloud defy the concept of “jurisdiction” itself? Should it be subject to the laws where the servers or company storing the data is based or be attached to the account holder and subject to those laws? Would the latter pose too much of a challenge for newer tech companies, leaving users with the major companies whose consolidated power would continue unchecked?</li>         
        </ol>
