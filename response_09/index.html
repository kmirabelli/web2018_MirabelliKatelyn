        <h2>Design As Art by Bruno Munari</h2>
        <h3>Questions/Topics</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Are Munari's ideas about combining materials and projecting them onto walls as art still relevant today, now that we operate mostly digitally? How can physical/natural elements be combined into digital work?</li>
            <br>
            <li>Is it essential that all technology eventually become outdated? Will it ever be reduced so small as to exist invisibly?</li>         
        </ol>
