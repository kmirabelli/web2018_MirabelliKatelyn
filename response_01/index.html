        <h3>Questions/Topics</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>How might one begin to consider accessibility issues/standards and device limitations when developing an online exhibit that is highly customized and unique? In other words, how can inclusivity be ensured while diverging from a standard art/design web-based exhibition?</li>
            <br>
            <li>The author writes that "this essay is not a call to artists to hire designers who will build them custom-made sites....Instead, it looks at the artistâ€™s website as what it could be: an online exhibition platform." What are the features that distinguish the two? How would limited technical knowledge create a barrier to entry into this kind of experimentation?</li>         
        </ol>
